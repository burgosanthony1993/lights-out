This is a lights-out game where the goal is to have all the lights out.
Each cell on is "true". To win, you'll need all cells marked "false".
When you win, you will get a "You Win" message, and the board will dissappear.
Read the code, especially the parent component where almost everything has notes to explain what each part does and how they connect with each other.
